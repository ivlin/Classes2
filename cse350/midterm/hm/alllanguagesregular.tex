\noindent
Given below is a proof to show that all languages are regular. State very
clearly and explicitly what is wrong with the following proof and why.
\bigskip\bigskip

The proof is by induction on the size of the language.

\bigskip

{\bf Base cases:} $n \in \{ 0, 1 \}$

The empty set is a regular language, and any one-element set is a regular language. Therefore every language of size $0$ or $1$ is regular.

\bigskip

{\bf Inductive step:} Assume that all languages of size $n$ are regular. Let $L$ be any language of size $n+1$, and choose some string $w \in L$. Then $|L-\{w\}| = n$, so by the inductive hypothesis, $L-\{w\}$ is regular. Since $L = \{w\} \cup (L-\{w\})$ and regular languages are closed under union, $L$ is regular. Since we assumed nothing about $L$ other than its size, any language of size $n+1$ is regular.

\bigskip

Therefore, by induction, all languages are regular.

\bigskip

The problem with this proof is that it does not take into account countably infinite languages where we can't simply assume a size $(\infty-1)$ language is regular to prove a size $\infty$ language is also regular since both are essentially equivalent.
